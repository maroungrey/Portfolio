# My Portfolio Website
View the live version of the project: https://maroungrey.com/

This is a portfolio website that I created as part of my journey to learn React. It uses React, Node.js, and Bootstrap, and I've incorporated several React modules to enhance the functionality of the site.

### About the Project
I started by following along with a React course on Udemy, but then decided to completely rework the project on my own. I ran into some difficulties along the way, such as issues with the `react-typical` module, which caused problems with my node dependencies and prevented me from deploying the website.

To solve this problem, I created a new (this) repository and started over. Fortunately, I was able to restore my progress quickly and didn't have to rework any of my CSS or JavaScript files. My old repository is available here: https://github.com/maroungrey/PortfolioSite

### Features
My portfolio website features a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. I've also incorporated several React modules to enhance the functionality of the site. For example, I used `react-type-animation` to add the typing animation im the Hero and Contact Me sections, and `react-owl-carousel` for the Testimonials section.

### Getting Started
To run the project locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run npm install to install the project dependencies.
Run npm start to start the development server.
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the website.

### Acknowledgements
I want to give a shoutout to the Udemy course that I initially followed (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-js-responsive-portfolio-website/), as it provided a great foundation for me to build upon. I also want to thank the developers of the various React modules that I used in my project, as they helped me to add additional functionality to my site.
